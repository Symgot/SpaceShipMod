custom gui that uses space hub inventory, that way stuff is hidden

need to do: -=important,--=less important
-add check to not let ship go into auto if there is not a port selected
-add docking port ship limit logic
-add more conditions (puke)
-Adjust the clone function to run over multiple ticks when the player is not on the ship (don't want your 200 ships dropping your UPS to 1 when the big logistics get going)

--fix dock final (not spawning entities)
--add check to takeoff to make sure platform is on its own surface
--change the gui captions to the ones in core/locale/en/core.cfg were viable
--spell check,Code clean up and restructuring
--Change to allow robots in space? (that way everything doesn't have to be belted)

Suggestions:
-Galdoc
--Was thinking if like, a planet had automated defenses or something, and that manifested with small ships sorta 'teleporting' in (because I have no idea how to animate them moving in) and shooting weapons at the player's ship or whatever
----trigger an event that teleport the player ship the a new surface and have the ships move close together (destroying a % of the enemy ship would allow the player to "savage" the other ship, whether that be take parts or link up to the current ship so it can be "towed" back to a station to be made into a complete ship again

    walls = {}--not used yet
    name = string

    player_owner = person who created it
    scanned = bool (need to scan to log ship info, should be fired any time the ship changes)
    player_in_cockpit = playerLua in cockpit
    taking_off = bool (should be renamed to docking)
    own_surface = bool (check if ship is on its own surface before letting it do automatic stuff)
    hub = entity
    schedule = {name,schedule{base game}} (used for automation and saving info between docking)
    port_records = {record_number,port_entity_unit_number} (This will be tied to whatever staion and a port, used for auto docking)
    floor = {positions} (tile positions)
    entities = {entities} (we need this to clone all entities)(count be changed later to make it scan when docking/undocking if more efficient)
    referance_tile = {x,y} (pick first tile found when scanning to use for referance later)
    surface = LuaSurface
    planet_orbiting = string (need to know this for automation, could potentialy use surface to get it as well if more efficient.)
