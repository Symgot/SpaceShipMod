# Transfer/Request Mod Implementation Summary

## Components Created

### 1. TransferRequest.lua Module
- **Purpose**: Standalone module for platform-to-platform item transfers
- **Key Features**:
  - Orbit detection (only transfers when platforms are in same orbit)
  - Request management system
  - Storage capacity validation
  - Deadlock prevention
  - UPS-friendly batched processing (max 10 transfers per tick)
  - Transfer cooldowns to prevent spam
  - Minimum quantity thresholds
  - Compatible with SpaceShip mod transfer restrictions

### 2. GUI Integration (SpaceShipGuisScript.lua)
- **create_transfer_request_gui**: Main GUI for managing transfer requests
- **handle_transfer_request_buttons**: Event handler for GUI buttons
- Shows current orbit status
- Allows adding/removing transfer requests
- Displays all active requests

### 3. Control.lua Updates
- Initialized TransferRequest module
- Added periodic processing (every 60 ticks)
- Added periodic cleanup (every 5 minutes)
- Integrated GUI events for cargo landing pads
- Added button click handlers

### 4. Localization
- English locale strings for messages
- German locale strings for messages
- Messages for request registration, removal, and transfers

### 5. Documentation
- Updated readme.md with feature description
- Added usage instructions
- Added testing guide

## Technical Details

### Transfer Logic
1. Every 60 ticks, process_requests() is called
2. Iterates through all platforms with requests (max 10 transfers per tick)
3. For each request:
   - Check if platform is in orbit
   - Find other platforms in same orbit
   - Validate transfer is allowed (respects ship-to-ship restriction)
   - Check for deadlocks
   - Verify source has minimum quantity
   - Check destination has space
   - Perform transfer
   - Set cooldown

### Deadlock Prevention
- Before transferring from A to B, checks if A has requests for items that B has
- If circular dependency detected, transfer is blocked
- This prevents infinite loops where platforms wait for each other

### UPS Optimization
- Batched processing (max 10 transfers per tick)
- Cooldown between transfers (5 seconds)
- Periodic cleanup of stale data
- Early exit conditions

### Storage Capacity Validation
- Calculates free space in cargo landing pads
- Accounts for partial stacks
- Tracks in-transit items (placeholder for future enhancement)
- Ensures transfers don't overflow destination

## Compatibility

### With SpaceShip Mod
- Uses Stations.validate_transfer() for transfer rules
- Respects ship-to-ship transfer restrictions
- Works with platform types (station/ship)

### Standalone
- Can work without SpaceShip mod features
- Falls back to allowing all transfers if no restrictions defined

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- Transfers are instant (not using actual cargo pods)
- In-transit tracking is placeholder only
- GUI only accessible via cargo landing pad
- No circuit network integration
- No statistics/logging

### Potential Improvements
- Use actual cargo pods for transfers
- Add circuit network signals for requests
- Add statistics tracking
- Add notification system for completed transfers
- Add priority system for requests
- Add request templates

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create two platforms in same orbit
- [ ] Add cargo landing pads to both
- [ ] Configure request on platform A
- [ ] Supply items on platform B
- [ ] Verify transfer occurs
- [ ] Test transfer restrictions (ship-to-ship)
- [ ] Test deadlock prevention
- [ ] Test minimum quantity thresholds
- [ ] Test storage capacity limits
- [ ] Test GUI element interactions
- [ ] Test with multiple platforms
- [ ] Test cleanup of deleted platforms
