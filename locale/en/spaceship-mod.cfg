[item-description]
spaceship-armor=Advanced armor designed for spaceship operations. Provides the same protection as mech armor but with enhanced space compatibility. Required for space travel and drop pod operations.
spaceship-control-hub=Main control hub for the spaceship. Place on spaceship flooring to create your ship's command center.
spaceship-flooring=Special tiles that define your ship's structure. Thrusters can only be placed on spaceship flooring.
spaceship-docking-port=Docking port for spaceship. Enables automated docking at space stations.
spaceship-wall=Reinforced walls for spaceship construction.
space-station-starter-pack=Creates a stationary space platform (station). Station mode: thrusters are ineffective, platform remains paused at location. Can toggle to ship mode at hub.
space-ship-starter-pack=Creates a mobile spaceship. Ship mode: can move via schedule and docking. Can toggle to station mode at hub.
